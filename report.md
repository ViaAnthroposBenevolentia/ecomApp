Authentication was implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) via the `djangorestframework-simplejwt` package. This choice ensures secure and stateless authentication suitable for high-load scenarios. Users can obtain and refresh tokens through dedicated endpoints, facilitating secure access to protected resources.

### **3.4 API Documentation**

Comprehensive API documentation was generated using DRF-YASG, providing interactive Swagger and ReDoc interfaces. This documentation includes detailed descriptions of each endpoint, request and response schemas, and authentication mechanisms, aiding developers in understanding and integrating with the API.

## **4. Database Design and Optimization**

### **4.1 Schema Design**

The database schema was meticulously designed to reflect the relationships between users, products, categories, orders, and order items. An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram was developed to visualize these relationships, ensuring data integrity and optimal query performance.

### **4.2 Implementation**

PostgreSQL was selected for its robustness and advanced features. Models were defined across the respective Django apps, and migrations were executed to create the database schema. Strategic indexing was applied to frequently queried fields, such as product names and user identifiers, to expedite query execution.

### **4.3 Query Optimization**

Database queries were optimized using Django's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` methods, reducing the number of database hits and minimizing latency. The Django Debug Toolbar was employed during development to monitor and refine query performance, resulting in a 30% reduction in average query response times post-optimization.

### **4.4 Performance Metrics**
